# TopDown2DShooter
Experimental Top Down 2D Shooting Game in Unity

The directory named *TopDown2DShooter-Proj* is the Unity project.

I personally find having the Unity project in a sub-directory (as opposed to having the Unity project directory as the top level in the rep) is ideal, as you can have non-project assets in the repo (like this README file, for example).

I've always loved top-down / twin-stick shooters since playing Smash TV in the arcades, so my goal is create something simple and fun.

<b>Update:</b></br>
I've re-implemented some of the things I've discovered while working and experimenting on this project in my more current project:</br>
